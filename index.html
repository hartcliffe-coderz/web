                        <h2>Game Development</h2>
                        <p>
                            Scratch is used as one of the tools for our game
                            development summer camp. It is a visual programming
                            language that is designed specifically for young
                            people, making it an ideal platform for introducing
                            beginners to the world of coding and game
                            development.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Scratch allows you to create games by dragging and
                            dropping blocks of code, rather than typing out
                            lines of text. This makes it easy to experiment with
                            different programming concepts and create complex
                            games without needing to memorise complex syntax.
                            For those of you who are up for a challenge, we will
                            explore together the programming language Python.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You will learn how to create characters, animate
                            movements, design levels, and add sound effects and
                            music to create an immersive gaming experience.
                            You'll have access to all the necessary tools and
                            equipment, including laptops and development
                            software, so you can make the most of your learning
                            experience.
