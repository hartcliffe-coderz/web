   <h2>About My Pets</h2>

   

   <p>I have a rabbit and a cat but if I still had all of my old pets... my house would be a zoo!
    I used to have 2 dogs, african land snails and 2 rats.
    Most of them had animal pellets, nothing special, the only different foods were eaten by my rabbit , my snails and my cat, can you guess what their different foods are ? </p>
