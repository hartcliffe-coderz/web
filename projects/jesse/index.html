        Society and governments aren't set up to protect everyone who needs it. That's why charities are here to fill
        the gaps and provide dedicated resources to help the most vulnerable. For children, they rely on their parents
        or carers to give them safety, guidance, and access to life's necessities.Charity is essential and therefore
        meant to be done for public benefit, relief and to provide assistance to people at times of need in any part of
        the world, especially those who are the victims of war, natural disaster, catastrophe, hunger, disease, poverty,
        orphans by supplying them with food, shelter, medical aid
