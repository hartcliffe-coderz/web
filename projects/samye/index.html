            her grandfather George V who she called "Grandpa England". Four years later her younger sister Princess
            Margaret was born on the 21st of August 1930.The two Princess had a shelterd childhood since they were home
            schooled by their mother and governer.They mainly studied english literature,languages,music and history.In

    <h2>During WW2</h2>
    <p>When the war first broke out,Elizabeth was 13 and her sister was 9.Both the Princesses were evacuated to
        Winsor castle as their parents thought that it would be safer there than at buckingham palace. Then in
        1944,when the princess turned 18 she signed up for service as she wanted "to do her part" for the war just
        like her peers.But her signing up for service was an unpresedented decicion. She was the first woman in the
        royal family to be a full time member of the armed services.While she was training,she was treated like
        everyone else it was only in the evening that she went home to Winsor castle.In 1245 she passed her test of
        being a mechanic and motor driver and then later on graduated as a fully qualified driver. But just as she
        finished her training,the war had ended so she was not able to use any of her newly learnt skills. </p>
